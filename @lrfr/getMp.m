% Determine Plastic Moment of Composite Seection
%  - AASHTO LRFD Manual Appendix D6
%
% Plastic forces in steel portions of the cross-section are calculated
% using the yield strengths of the flanges, web, and reinforcing steel, as
% appropriate. 
%
% Compressive stress = 0.85f'c
% Concrete in tension neglected
% Forces in longitudinal reinforcement conservatively ignored
%  
% Mp - plastic moment of the composite section
% Dpst - distance from the top of slab to PNA [in]
% Dcp - depth of the web in compression at the plastic moment
% id - integer case identifier per Table D6.1-1 for PNA location
